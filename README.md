# Atlas

Atlas is a modular back end framework, which I made for a specific project.

## Setup

To use Atlas simply clone the repository, and run:

```cmd
composer dumpautoload
```
```cmd
npm install
```

Or clone [my structure tool](https://github.com/ThePope05/StructureTool), which also contains the Atlas framework.
And then run (you still need to run the commands above):

```cmd
make Atlas 'your_project_name'
```

## Running the project

To local host run:

```cmd
php Atlas localhost
```
```cmd
npm run dev
```

current version 0.2
