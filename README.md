# Atlas

Atlas is a modular back end framework, which I made for a specific project.

## Setup

To use Atlas simply clone the repository, and run:

```cmd
composer dumpautoload
```

Or clone my structure tool, which also contains the Atlas framework.
And then run:

```cmd
make Atlas 'your_project_name'
```

Then to local host run:

```cmd
php Atlas localhost
```

current version 0.1
